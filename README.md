```

## 🛠 Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- **Node.js**: v20 or higher (Docker uses v24)
- **npm** (comes with Node.js)

## 🏃 Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository** (if you haven't already):

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd ums-frontend
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   The application will be running at `http://localhost:5173` (or the port specified by Vite).

## 📜 Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

- `npm run dev`: Starts the Vite development server.
- `npm run build`: Type-checks the TypeScript code and builds the app for production.
- `npm run build-local`: Similar to build, but uses the local environment configuration.
- `npm run preview`: Bootstraps a local web server to preview the production build.
- `npm run lint`: Runs ESLint to find and fix problems in your code.
- `npm run type-check`: Runs TypeScript compiler to verify typings without emitting files.

## 🐳 Docker Support

The project includes Docker configuration for easy deployment and containerized development.

### Running with Docker Compose

Start the application using Docker Compose:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:5200`.

### Building and Running Docker Image Manually

1. Build the image:

   ```bash
   docker build -t ums-frontend .
   ```

   _(Note: Use `--platform=linux/amd64` if building on an ARM machine like Mac M1/M2 for an AMD64 cloud provider.)_

2. Run the container:
   ```bash
   docker run -p 5200:5200 ums-frontend
   ```

## 🧹 Code Quality

- **ESLint** & **Prettier**: Configured to ensure consistent code styling and catch issues early.
- **Husky** & **lint-staged**: Pre-commit hooks are set up to run Prettier and format files before they are committed, ensuring a clean codebase.
